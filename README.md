# Simple render in OpenGL

### Implementation of a renderer that reads a CSV file to load the vertices

Basically the vertices are specified with 3 Positions plus 3 Colors and plus 2 Texture Coordinates, as the image below.

At the **Application.cpp** file there is a method called **read_csv_file** where the file is specified, in this project there are only two simple files, a 3D cube and a 3D House.
